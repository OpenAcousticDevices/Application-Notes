This is a default settings file. White space and indentation is ignored during parsing, but the order of the terms must be maintained. Anything before the first opening brace, and after the first closing brace, is ignored.

The settings are read when the switch is moved from USB/OFF to DEFAULT or CUSTOM and parsing errors are indicated by flashing both LED. The reason for the error will be reported in the LOG.TXT file.

There are two main recording options. The first one is for fixed starting times and provides a list of up to MAX_RECORDING_PERIODS = 10 active recording periods can be included. The recording periods must be in order of increasing start time and must not overlap. 

The second main option uses the GPS to acquire sunset and sunrise times, and calculates the recording periods appropriately. There are five modes set by the sunRecordingMode parameter. 

    Mode (0) makes one recording around sunrise.
    Mode (1) makes one recording around sunset.
    Mode (2) makes two separate recordings around both sunrise and sunset. 
    Mode (3) records during the night from before sunset to after sunrise.
    Mode (4) records during the day from before sunrise to after sunset.

There are four options set by the sunRecordingEvent parameter.

    Mode (0) uses sunrise and sunset.
    Mode (1) uses civil dawn and dusk.
    Mode (2) uses nautical dawn and dusk.
    Mode (3) uses astronomical dawn and dusk.

The settings file should contain either a recordingPeriods list or a sunRecording object. 

Both firstRecordingDate and lastRecordingDate are optional. 

An optional sleep/record cycle can be used with the additional constraint that the sleepDuration must be equal or greater than recordingFixDuration.

Here is an example using a recordingPeriods list with a sleep/record cycle.

{
    gain: 2,
    sampleRate: 48000,
    enableDailyFolders: 0,
    enableFilenameWithDeviceID: 0,
    enableLowGainRange: 0,
    enableMagneticSwitch: 0,
    disable48HzDCBlockingFilter: 0,
    enableAlternativeBatteryVoltageRange: 0,
    initialFixDuration: 120,
    intervalToNextFixAttempt: 60,
    recordingFixDuration: 60,
    sleepRecordCycle: {
        sleepDuration: 60,
        recordDuration: 240
    },
    recordingPeriods: [
        { startTime: "04:00", endTime: "08:00" },
        { startTime: "20:00", endTime: "24:00" }
    ],
    firstRecordingDate: "01/06/2024",
    lastRecordingDate: "01/07/2026"
}

Here is an alternate example that uses a sunRecording object with a sleep/record cycle. This one will be ignored since the one above will be read and parsed first.

{
    gain: 2,
    sampleRate: 48000,
    enableDailyFolders: 0,
    enableLowGainRange: 0,
    enableMagneticSwitch: 0,
    disable48HzDCBlockingFilter: 0,
    enableAlternativeBatteryVoltageRange: 0,
    initialFixDuration: 120,
    intervalToNextFixAttempt: 60,
    recordingFixDuration: 60,
    sleepRecordCycle: {
        sleepDuration: 60,
        recordDuration: 240
    },
    sunRecording: { 
        sunRecordingMode: 0,
        sunRecordingEvent: 1,
        sunRoundingMinutes: 5,
        sunriseInterval: {beforeMinutes: 30, afterMinutes: 30},
        sunsetInterval: {beforeMinutes: 30, afterMinutes: 30}
    },
    firstRecordingDate: "01/06/2024",
    lastRecordingDate: "01/07/2026"
}

The constraints imposed by the parser are:

    1. gain = 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
    2. sampleRate = 8000, 16000, 32000, 48000, 96000 or 125000
    3. enableLowGainRange, enableMagneticSwitch, disable48HzDCBlockingFilter and enableAlternativeVoltageRange = 0 or 1
    4. 0 <= initialFixDuration, intervalToNextFixAttempt, recordingFixDuration <= 3600
    5. sunRecordingMode = 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4
    6. sunRecordingEvent = 0, 1, 2 or 3
    7. 0 <= sunRoundingMinutes, beforeMinutes, afterMinutes <= 360
    8. sleepDuration >= recordingFixDuration

Some additional notes:

    1. The value of startTime and stopTime are given by hh:mm with 24:00 being accepted as midnight. 
    2. It is possible for the recording period to span midnight (e.g. { startTime: "20:00", stopTime: "04:00" }).
